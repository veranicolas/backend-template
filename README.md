# Backend Template

## This is a Node.js app template for future projects.

This app is fully tested and ready to deploy. The main idea behind this template is to maintaining it with the latest versions of it's dependencies. Also to have a BE ready to go in case of a project idea.

The app uses Typescript and Express. I thought of using Nest.js but I would like to keep it simple and homemade as possible.

This will startup as a monolith and who knows, eventually I might switch it to microservices or macro-services, but that's for the future.

## Instructions

- Click in <b>Use this template</b>
- Set your project's information
- Clone the repo
- `npm i` the bad boi
- Set your environment variables for the <b>PORT</b> and the database credentials

## Dependencies

- Typescript
- Express
- Pg
- Axios
- Jest
- ts-node-dev ---nodemon equivalent for typescript

## Notes

### This template will be updated frequently with the libraries latest versions so it may change quite a bit over time. For bigger projects I would recommend future me to use Nest, but for smaller frontend-centric projects this will do.
