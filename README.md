# Backend Template

## This is a Node.js app template for future projects.

This app is fully tested and ready to deploy. The main idea behind this template is to maintaining it with the latest versions of it's dependencies. Also to have a BE ready to go in case of a project idea.

The app uses Typescript and Express. I thought of using Nest.js but I would like to keep it simple and homemade as possible.

This will startup as a monolith and who knows, eventually I might switch it to microservices or macro-services, but that's for the future.
